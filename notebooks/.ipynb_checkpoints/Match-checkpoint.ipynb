    "Colocalizes the source variable (from source table) with the target variable (from target table). The matching results rely on the spatio-temporal tolerance parameters because they set the matching boundaries between the source and target datasets. Notice the source has to be a single non-climatological variable. You may pass empty string ('') as source variable if you only want to get the time and location info from the source table. Please note that the number of matching entries between each target variable and the source variable might vary depending on the temporal and spatial resolutions of the target variable. In principle, there should always be matching results if the tolerance parameters are larger than half of their corresponding spatial/temporal resolutions (except on land mask!). Please explore the [catalog](Catalog.ipynb) to find appropriate target  variables. This method returns a dataframe containing the source variable joined with the target variable(s).\n"
