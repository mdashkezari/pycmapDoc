    "This method colocalizes a cruise trajectory with the specified target variables. The matching results rely on the spatio-temporal tolerance parameters because these parameters set the matching boundaries between the cruise trajectory and target datasets. Please note that the number of matching entries for each target variable might vary depending on the temporal and spatial resolutions of the target variable. In principle, if the cruise trajectory is fully covered by the target variable's spatio-temporal range, there should always be matching results if the tolerance parameters are larger than half of their corresponding spatial/temporal resolutions.
